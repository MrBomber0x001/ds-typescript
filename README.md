# Typescript-based Implementation of Data Structures

## Plan

1. Each directory inside this repo represents a data structures, inside each directory the actual implementation in typescript in addition to notes related to that DS

2. Each DS has problem sets related to it, those PS are listed inside each dir.

> This repo is updated regularly from time to time, if you've any feedback or want to contribute, PRs are welcomed.

## Resources

The main resource for me was course by @primegen on FrontendMasters titled "TheLast Algorithms Course You will need" and he was right.

This resource was enough for me, but there are other ones, that might help
